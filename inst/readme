ExtraL
======  extra list manipulation commands for Tcl
        by Peter De Rijk (Universiteit Antwerpen) 

What is ExtraL
--------------

Most percieved performance problems with Tcl are caused by the large
overhead on loops, that have to be reinterpreted for each iteration.
This becomes especially noticable when working with large lists. I use
this extension to overcome this problem. It has several usefull
manipulations on lists in C code, and some convenience functions in Tcl
as well.

Documentation is still rather scarce unfortunately. You can find a short
description of all commands in the extral.txt file

Installation
------------
You should be able to obtain the latest version of ExtraL via anonymous ftp
on rrna.uia.ac.be. in the directory /pub/tcl

This package can be build as a loadable object to Tcl7.5 by adjusting
the appropriate Makefile and running make. (In doubt, it's a good bet
to copy most options used to compile the Tcl files.) It should be
initialised by calling the function Extral_Init

How to contact me
-----------------
I will do my best to reply as fast as I can to any problems, etc.
However, the development of extraL is not my only task,
which is why my response might not be always as fast as you would
like (although I get a very good average).
