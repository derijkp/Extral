<h1>ExtraL</h1>
<i>extra commands for Tcl<br>
by Peter De Rijk (Universiteit Antwerpen)
</i>

<h2>What is ExtraL</h2>
Extral is a generally useful library which extends Tcl with a.o.:
<ul>
<li>extral list manipulation commands
<li>array manipulation
<li>atexit
<li>dbm support: file based, gdbm and bsd-db support
<li>tempfile
<li>filing commands
<li>light eval (Viktor Dukhovni)
</ul>
The name comes from the fact that ExtraL originally only contained
extra list processing commands to overcome some of the performance 
problems in Tcl when processing large lists. Later other commands
were added. With the advent of the Tcl byte compiler, the 
performance is not such a great issue any longer, but I still find 
many of the list manipulation functions very convenient, and some 
of those that were now rewritten using the object system in C are 
still faster.
<p>
Most functions are now also available in Tcl-only form as well. Using 
the C code just gives a speedup.
<p>
You can find a short description of the commands in the files in the 
docs subdirectory. For some of the commands, you can find out a lot 
by checking the testing suite in the directory tests.

<h2>Incompatible changes</h2>
There were some incompatible changes with previous releases:
<ul>
<li>lremove syntax is now: lremove list indices
<li>I feel like I misnamed some commands in the previous releases. This 
has been changed now:<br>
	<ul>
	<li>lmerge acts like the former "lmanip mangle"
	<li>lunmerge acts like the reverse of lmerge
	<li>lmanip mangle does the previous "lmanip merge"
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
You should be able to obtain the latest version of ExtraL via anonymous ftp
on rrna.uia.ac.be. in the directory /pub/tcl
<p>
This package can be build as a loadable object to Tcl8.0. Go to the
src directory and type
<pre>
./configure --with-tcl=<path of tcl distribution>
make
</pre>
This should produce the loadable module. The build.tcl and
buildwin.tcl files are a tool to make a nice package in a different
directory.
<p>
If you want to make gdbm and bsd-db support, you will have to create a 
libgdbm.a and libdb.a (should position independend code) and put these
in the extern directory together with their header files. (gdbm.h and 
db_185.h) and do a 
<pre>
make gdbm.so
make bsddbm.so
</pre>

<h2>How to contact me</h2>
I will do my best to reply as fast as I can to any problems, etc.
However, the development of extraL is not my only task,
which is why my response might not be always as fast as you would
like.
