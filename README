ExtraL
======  extra commands for Tcl
        by Peter De Rijk (Universiteit Antwerpen) 

What is ExtraL
--------------

Extral is a generally useful library which extends Tcl with a.o.:
	- extral list manipulation commands
	- extra string manipulation commands
	- array manipulation
	- atexit
	- dbm support: file based, gdbm and bsd-db support
	- tempfile
	- filing commands
	- light eval (Viktor Dukhovni)
	
The name comes from the fact that ExtraL originally only contained
extra list processing commands to overcome some of the performance 
problems in Tcl when processing large lists. Later other commands
were added. With the advent of the Tcl byte compiler, the 
performance is not such a great issue any longer, but I still find 
many of the list manipulation functions very convenient, and some 
of those that were now rewritten using the object system in C are 
still faster. 
Most functions are now also available in Tcl-only form as well. Using 
the C code just gives a speedup.

You can find a short description of the commands in the files in the 
docs subdirectory. For some of the commands, you can find out a lot 
by checking the testing suite in the directory tests.

Installation
------------
You should be able to obtain the latest version of ExtraL via www on url
http://rrna.uia.ac.be/extral/ or via anonymous ftp
on rrna.uia.ac.be. in the directory /pub/tcl

Binary packages

A binary ExtraL package can be "installed" by placing it where Tcl can find
it. The command 
package require Extral
will load the package. A binary package does not necesarily contains
compiled code: If no compiled version (.so, .dll) is available, a 
Tcl-only version will be used.

Sources

The Tcl script makedist.tcl creates a package distribution
If no compiled version (.so, .dll) is available, a Tcl-only version will 
be created.

compiled packages for most Unix platform should be created using the following 
steps:
cd Extral-src-x.x.x/src
./configure
make
cd ..
./makedist.tcl

If you want to make gdbm and bsd-db support, you will have to create a 
libgdbm.a and libdb.a (should be position independend code) and put these
in the extern directory together with their header files. (gdbm.h and 
db_185.h) and do in the src directory:
make gdbm.so
make bsddbm.so

How to contact me
-----------------
I will do my best to reply as fast as I can to any problems, etc.
However, the development of extraL is not my only task,
which is why my response might not be always as fast as you would
like.
