ExtraL
======  extra commands for Tcl
        by Peter De Rijk (Universiteit Antwerpen) 

What is ExtraL
--------------

Extral is a generally useful library which extends Tcl with a.o.:
	- extral list manipulation commands
	- extra string manipulation commands
	- array manipulation
	- atexit
	- tempfile
	- filing commands
	
The name comes from the fact that ExtraL originally only contained
extra list processing commands to overcome some of the performance 
problems in Tcl when processing large lists. Later other commands
were added. With the advent of the Tcl byte compiler, the 
performance is not such a great issue any longer, but I still find 
many of the list manipulation functions very convenient, and some 
of those that were now rewritten using the object system in C are 
still faster. 
Most functions are now also available in Tcl-only form as well. Using 
the C code just gives a speedup.

You can find a short description of the commands in the files in the 
docs subdirectory. For some of the commands, you can find out a lot 
by checking the testing suite in the directory tests.

Changes
-------
This release contains many changes with regards to previous releases. Many
commands have been renamed in order to get a more clear and consistent
naming scheme. There is a small compatibility layer for old releases, but
it is adviced to use the new command names. leval has been removed.
The dbm support will be moved to a seperate package.

Installation
------------
You should be able to obtain the latest version of ExtraL via www on url
http://rrna.uia.ac.be/extral/ or via anonymous ftp
on rrna.uia.ac.be. in the directory /pub/tcl

Binary packages

A binary ExtraL package can be "installed" by placing it where Tcl can find
it. The command 
package require Extral
will load the package. A binary package does not necesarily contains
compiled code: If no compiled version (.so, .dll) is available, a 
Tcl-only version will be used.

Sources

The Tcl script makedist.tcl creates a package distribution
If no compiled version (.so, .dll) is available, a Tcl-only version will 
be created.

During compilation, the Tcl sources must be availble; if the Tcl source
directory is not a sibling of the Extral source directory, you will have to
specify its position by giving a parameter to the ./configure script:
./configure --with-tcl=DIR (where DIR is the Tcl source tree)
in the following description.

compiled packages for most Unix platform should be created using the following 
steps:
cd Extral-src-x.x.x/src
./configure
make
cd ..
./makedist.tcl

How to contact me
-----------------
I will do my best to reply as fast as I can to any problems, etc.
However, the development of extraL is not my only task,
which is why my response might not be always as fast as you would
like.
