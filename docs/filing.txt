Filing commands
---------------
dirglob dir pattern
lload filename
lwrite filename list
readfile filename
writefile filename list

Extras
------
These will disappear as Tcl now has these commands in the file command
commands to mimick (for some part) the Unix filing commands. Under Unix, they
call the actual Unix commands after doing wildcart substitution. Under Windows
functionality is more limited.
mkdir		make a directory
ls		list files
chmod		change permissions
cp		copy files
mv		move files
rm		remove files
