<h1>Date and time</h1>

The time_scan transforms a string containing date and/or time into a 
a list of two integers (number of days since 0, and number of miliseconds in that day). 
These values can be sorted (-dictionary), compared or stored, and transformed back 
into a human readable date and time string using the time_format command. The clock scan and
format commands in Tcl give up before somewhere before 1901 and after
2037, which is a bit of a bummer (eg. for genealogy). The transformation
takes into account leap-years properly. However, it extrapolated
the current rule to the past (so eg. 0004 BC is a leap year), and doesn't
take into account the meddling that has happened to time over 
time (missing days, ...) because this is nearly impossible to do
correctly (I am not an historian).
The format of the internal time has been changed since a previous version to using a 
list of two integers instead of one double value because the accuracy was not good 
enough to store miliseconds
