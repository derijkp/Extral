atexit add command
</b><dd>
	adds a command to the atexit handler: This command will be executed when
	the program exits. It can be used to do a cleanup. This command redefines
	the exit command. If you use it in Tk, and you exit by calling "destroy ."
	it will not work. You can redefine the destroy command to call exit when it 
	has . as an argument.
