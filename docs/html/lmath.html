<h1>Mathematical commands on whole lists</h1>

<dl><b><dt>
	lmath_cumul ?list?
</b><dd>
	returns a list containing the cumulative sums of the numbers in the list

<b><dt>
	lmath_incr ?list? ?value?
</b><dd>
	returns a list containing the numbers in the list incremented by value

<b><dt>
	lmath_between ?list? ?min? ?max?
</b><dd>
	returns a list containing the numbers in the list but with a minimum and maximum:
	Any value higher than the maximum is changed to the maximum.
	Any value lower than the minimum is changed to the minimum.

<b><dt>
	lmath_stdev ?list? ??main??
</b><dd>
	returns the standard deviation of the numbers in the list.

<b><dt>
	lmath_majority ?list?
</b><dd>
	returns the most representative of the numbers in the list.
	This calculated by using gravity scoring: Each number in the list
	adds to the score depending on the distance to the supported number
	The number with the most support is returned.
	Where more than one number gets the same amount of support (e.g. evenly spaced)
	The average of the best supported numbers is returned

<b><dt>
	lmath_majoritydev ?list? ?majority?
</b><dd>
	returns the most representative deviation of values in list 
	from the given ?majority? number

<b><dt>
	lmath_calc ?list1? ?action? ?list2?
</b><dd>
	makes calculations on lists. Action can be one of +, -, * or /
	list2 may also be a single number, in which case
	this number will be used for all elements in list1
<br>eg.:<pre>
	% lmath_calc {1 2 3.2 4} + {1 2 3.2 4}
	2.0 4.0 6.4 8.0
</pre>
<b><dt>
	lmath_sum ?list?
</b><dd>
	returns the sum of the numbers in the list

<b><dt>
	lmath_between ?list?
</b><dd>
	returns the average of the numbers in the list.

<b><dt>
	lmath_min ?list?
</b><dd>
	returns the minimum of the numbers in the list

<b><dt>
	lmath_max ?list?
</b><dd>
	returns the maximum of the numbers in the list

<b><dt>
	lmath_filter list filter ?filterpos? ?unfilteredvalue?
</b><dd>
	applies the filter by sliding it over the list, multiplying all elements of the filter with 
	the current elements in the list, and changing the list element in the middle of the 
	filter (or at filterpos) with the sum of the products.
	The numbers at the beginning and end of the list that are not covered by the filter, are given the value
	of the first, respectively last element that can be calculated, unless a value for these is
	explicitly given (unfilteredvalue)
	returns the filtered list
