<h2>What is ExtraL</h2>
Extral is a generally useful library which extends Tcl with a.o.(<a

<li><a href="lmath.html">Mathematical commands on whole lists</a>
<li><a href="stringcommands.html">Extra string manipulation commands</a>
<li><a href="arraycommands.html">Extra array manipulation commands</a>
<li><a href="cmd.html">Command manipulation commands</a>
<li><a href="validatecommands.html"> Validation commands</a>: isint, isdouble
<li><a href="map.html">Maps</a>: store structured data in lists
<li><a href="filing.html">Filing commands</a>
<li><a href="infocommands.html">Info commands</a>
<li><a href="time.html">Date and time</a>:  extra commands for handling dates
<li><a href="atexit.html">atexit</a>: execute commands when Tcl exits
<li><a href="tempfile.html">tempfile</a>:  get names for temporary files
<li><a href="struct.html">Structures</a>
<li><a href="convenience.html">Convenience functions</a>: various useful procs
<li><a href="ssort.html">ssort</a>: enhanced lsort
</ul>
The name comes from the fact that ExtraL originally only contained
extra list processing commands to overcome some of the performance 
problems in Tcl when processing large lists. Later other commands
were added. With the advent of the Tcl byte compiler, the 
performance is not such a great issue any longer, but I still find 
many of the list manipulation functions very convenient, and some 
of those that were now rewritten using the object system in C are 
still faster.
<p>
Most functions are now also available in Tcl-only form as well. Using 
the C code just gives a speedup.
<p>
You can find a short description of the commands in the files in the 
docs subdirectory. For some of the commands, you can find out a lot 
by checking the testing suite in the directory tests.

<h2>Installation</h2>
You should be able to obtain the latest version of ExtraL via www on url
http://extral.sourceforge.net/
<p>
This package can be build as a loadable object to Tcl8.0. Go to the
src directory and type
<pre>
./configure --with-tcl=<path of tcl distribution>
make
</pre>
This should produce the loadable module. The build.tcl and
buildwin.tcl files are a tool to make a nice package in a different
directory.

<h2>How to contact me</h2>
I will do my best to reply as fast as I can to any problems, etc.
However, the development of extraL is not my only task,
which is why my response might not be always as fast as you would
like.
