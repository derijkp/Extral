<h1>Convenience functions</h1>

<dl><b><dt>
invoke vars cmd ...
</b><dd>
 invoke simply evals $cmd in a private space. This eg. allows using
 temporary variables in bindings without creating these in global scope.
 It is also very convenient to use values appended to a command given
 to a binding:
 Further arguments (when given) are parameters that will be available in the
 variables given in vars. If more parameters are supplied than vars are given,
 the remaining parameters will be stored in the variable args.

<b><dt>
	list_iterate variableName list
</b><dd>
	debugging tool to interactively iterate a variable over a list. list_iterate
	is used to initialise and it sets the variable to the first element of 
	the list. Every 'list_next variableName' will puts the next element into the 
	variable.

<b><dt>
	list_next variableName
</b><dd>
	complement to list_iterate. sets the variable to the next element of the list 
	first given by list_iterate.

<b><dt>
aproc args body
</b><dd>
 aproc creates an 'anonymous' procedure; this means you don't have to provide a name. It
 returns the name to invoke it. These procedures are cached based on the arguments and body.
 This is actually somewhat similar to the invoke command, but is faster when the proc
 is being reused many times.
 Typical use would be in parameters that expect a command name that will be called later with 
 a number of arguments:
 .ctable configure -getcommand [aproc {args} {return $args}]

<b><dt>
? expr truevalue falsevalue
</b><dd>
 ? expr truevalue falsevalue

<b><dt>
echo string
</b><dd>
 echo returns its argument as a result
 This is useful when you want a command that will be evalled or upleveled
 to return a certain value
 

<b><dt>
rem args
</b><dd>
	does nothing<br>
	I use this to put some example or testing code in a program
	without all the #'s

<b><dt>
REM args
</b><dd>
	when the procedure remof is called, REM will also do nothing
	when the procedure remon is called, REM will put its arguments
	to the stdout

<b><dt>
true expression
</b><dd>
 true expr
	returns 1 when expression is yes, true or 1<br>
	otherwise it returns 0.

<b><dt>
 setglobal varName ?newValue?
</b><dd>
	same as the set command, but then for global variables

<b><dt>
random min max
</b><dd>
returns a random number between min and max

<b><dt>
putsvars varname ?varname ...?
</b><dd>
returns the values of the given variables in the form:<br>
set variable1 value1<br>
set variable2 value2

<b><dt>
 error_preserve
</b><dd>
 preserves the error information in the variables errorInfo.
 Preserved information will be restored with the command error_restore

<b><dt>
 today
</b><dd>
 returns current time in astronomical format: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

<b><dt>
varsubst string varlist valuelist
</b><dd>
	substitutes only the variables in varlist for their content
	in the given string
<br>eg.:<pre>
	% set try {try it}
	try it
	% varsubst {try} {
		puts [list $try $try2]
	}
		puts [list {try it} $try2]
</pre>
