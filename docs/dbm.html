Dbm

The database support in dbm can have different backends: availble backend 
systems are
<dl>
<dt>fdbm
<dd>file system based; slow but easy, relatively safe and very portable
<dt>gdbm
<dd>using the gdbm routines; as a loadable module (gdbm.so)
<dt>bsddbm
<dd>using the bsd db routines; as a loadable module (bsddbm.so)
this seems to be the faster and more reliable than gdbm
</dl>
Several of the commands can have options depending on the type of dbm.
New backends can be added (in C) using the ExtraL_DbmCreateType function.
The database code can also be used from C using the ExtraL_DbmOpen function.

<h2>dbm command</h2><dl><b><dt>
dbm types
</b><dd>
	list the available type of database systems; fdbm is provided,
	gdbm and bsddbm are dynamically loadable
<b><dt>
dbm create type database ?options?
</b><dd>
	create a database of the given type (fdbm, gdbm, bsddbm) in 
	the "file" database. The database is not opened by this command.
<b><dt>
dbm open type dbcmd database ?options?
</b><dd>
	open a database for reading (read = default) or reading and 
	writing (write).
	type: the type of the database (fdbm, gdbm, bsddbm).
	dbcmd: the command by which the opened database can be queried
	database: place of the database in the filing system

</dl><h2>
database commands
</h2>
The dbmcmd created by the "dbm open" above will have the following options:
<dl><b><dt>
	dbmcmd set key value
</b><dd>
		set key in the database to value.
<b><dt>
	dbmcmd get key
</b><dd>
		get the value associated with key from the database.
<b><dt>
	dbmcmd unset key
</b><dd>
		remove a key from the database.
<b><dt>
	dbmcmd keys ?pattern?
</b><dd>
		return the keys in the database.
<b><dt>
	dbmcmd close
</b><dd>
		close the database. The dbmcmd will be removed
<b><dt>
	dbmcmd sync
</b><dd>
		sync the database (for those types that need it).
<b><dt>
	dbmcmd reorganize
</b><dd>
		reorganize the database (for those types that need it).
