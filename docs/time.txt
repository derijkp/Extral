Date and time
-------------
The scantime transforms a string containing date and/or time into a 
double value (number of seconds since 0). These values can
be sorted, compared or stored, and transformed back into a human readable
date and time string using the formattime command. The clock scan and
format commands in Tcl give up before somewhere before 1901 and after
2037, which is a bit of a bummer (eg. for genealogy). The transformation
takes into account leap-years properly (I hope). However, it extrapolated
the current rule to the past (so eg. 0004 BC is a leap year), and doesn't
take into account the meddling that has happened to time over 
time (missing days, ...). I don't know enough about that to do this
correctly.

scantime time ?date/time/both?
	!! the year should be specified fully (>=4 numbers)
	eg.:
		% scantime {9 May 1997 12:30}
		62998777800.0
formattime time ?formatstring?
	!! not all options of clock scan are supported
	%% : %
	%Y : year
	%d : day (09)
	%e : day (9)
	%j : day of year
	%m : month number
	%b : abbreviated month name
	%B : full month name
	%H : hour
	%M : minute
	%S : second
	%s : hundreds of a second
	eg.:
		% formattime 62998777800.0
		1997 May 09 12:30:00
		% formattime 62998777800.0 "%B %e %Y"
		May 9 1997
