<dl><b><dt>
leval command $args
</b><dd>
	converted the leval patch by Viktor Dukhovni <viktor@esm.com> to
	a dynamically loadable version:
	This command is a fast light "eval" specifically designed to execute
	zero or more Tcl lists (concatenated) by invoking the command specified
	by the first list element, with the remaining list elements as "literal"
	arguments.  No variable or command substitution takes place on the
	arguments.
	The Tcl only version is not faster
