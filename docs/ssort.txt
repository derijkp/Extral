	enhanced lsort:
		by D. Richard Hipp -- drh@tobit.vnet.net -- 704.948.4565 :
			- re-entrant and thread-safe: eg. ssort can be used in its
			  own -command proc
				- 10% faster
			- option -dictionary: Using -dict, "B" comes in between
			  "a" and "b".  Also "x10" comes after "x9" 
		by Peter De Rijk :
			extra option -reflist: sort the elements in the list according
			to the comparisons of the corresponding elements in the 
			reflist.
