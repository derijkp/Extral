Date and time
</h1>

The scantime transforms a string containing date and/or time into a 
double value (number of seconds since 0). These values can
be sorted, compared or stored, and transformed back into a human readable
date and time string using the formattime command. The clock scan and
format commands in Tcl give up before somewhere before 1901 and after
2037, which is a bit of a bummer (eg. for genealogy). The transformation
takes into account leap-years properly (I hope). However, it extrapolated
the current rule to the past (so eg. 0004 BC is a leap year), and doesn't
take into account the meddling that has happened to time over 
time (missing days, ...). I don't know enough about that to do this
correctly.
